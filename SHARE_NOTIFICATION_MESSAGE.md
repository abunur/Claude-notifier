üîî Get Notified When Claude Code Finishes!

Hey team! I've set up a simple notification system that plays a sound when Claude Code (or any long-running task) completes. Super useful when you're waiting for builds or letting Claude work on something complex.

**Quick Install (30 seconds):**
1. Download: [attach install_notifications.sh]
2. Run: `bash install_notifications.sh`
3. Test: `notify-test`

**How to use:**
‚Ä¢ Type `notify-done` or just `nd` when Claude is processing
‚Ä¢ Use `run-notify ./gradlew build` for auto-notifications on any command

Works on macOS. Takes literally 30 seconds to set up! 

Let me know if you want help setting it up! üöÄ

Subject: Claude Code Notification Tool - Never Miss When It's Done!

Hi [Team/Name],

I wanted to share a quick productivity tool I've been using with Claude Code. It's a simple notification system that plays a sound and shows a desktop alert when Claude finishes processing or when long builds complete.

**Why it's useful:**
- No more constantly checking if Claude is done thinking
- Get alerted when builds/tests finish
- Works with any command-line task

**Installation (takes 1 minute):**
1. Save the attached installer script
2. Run: bash install_notifications.sh
3. That's it!

**Usage:**
- Just type "notify-done" when you want to be alerted
- Or use "run-notify" before any command for automatic notifications

I've attached the installer script and documentation. It only works on macOS currently, but can be adapted for Linux.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

Best,
[Your name]
